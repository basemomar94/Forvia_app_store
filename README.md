### Forvia App Store

### Architecture

The app adheres to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, promoting a clean, scalable, and testable codebase:

- **Model**: Defines the app's data structure and handles domain-level logic.
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate the core business logic, ensuring clean interaction between repositories and ViewModels.
- **ViewModel**: Manages and prepares data for the UI layer while handling app state and business logic in a lifecycle-aware manner.
- **View**: Built using XML layouts for a seamless user experience.
- **Repository**: Serves as a mediator between the data sources (network, database) and the use cases.

### Used Libraries

- **Kotlin**: Main programming language for the app.
- **XML Views**: For the UI layer.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifies in-app navigation.
- **Hilt**: Provides dependency injection for a modular, scalable codebase.
- **Retrofit**: Handles network requests and API calls.
- **Room**: Manages local database storage.
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous programming and state management.
- **MockK** & **JUnit5**: For testing business logic and app components.
- **Glide**: Efficient image loading and caching.

### Key Implementations

- **Error Handling**: Robust error management to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **State Management**: Powered by StateFlow to efficiently handle UI state changes.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplified and scalable using Hilt.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Validate business logic and use cases using JUnit5 and MockK.
- **Instrumented Tests**: Ensure data integrity and correct Room Database operations.

### Possible Improvement

- **UI Tests**: Verify the behavior and interaction of UI components using Espresso.
